1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    ReactJS is a JavaScript framework, it attempts to solve displaying large amounts of data in a streamlined, dynamic, clear and concise way.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    Thinking in React is to think in terms of Components and a component tree and how the components will interact with data via props and class component states.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    A class/state component is able to hold and update data stored in its 'state'. Updating this state will instantaneously rerender the DOM when state is updated and components/props are assigned to the data. Functional components just render immutable data to the screen that you pass to it.

4.  Describe state.

    State is an object that allows you to create React class components that are dynamic and interactive, you can use state to rerender a component and update its 'state' on the DOM/viewport/in the component.

5.  Describe props.

    A Prop is similar to a function parameter in Vanilla JS. We can give components props, in essence giving a component some immutable data.
